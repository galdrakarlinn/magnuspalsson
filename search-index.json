An early sculptural work from 1962 demonstrating Magnús Pálsson's exploration of geometric forms and spatial relationships. This piece represents his early artistic development and interest in abstraction during his formative years as an artist. The work shows his experimentation with materials and form that would later develop into his more conceptual practice. 1962 sculpture geometric early work 1960s abstract wood paint wood paint viður paint",

Made by stuffing old cloths with paper, stiffening with glue and paint until hard, then removing the paper so the cloth figures could stand like empty skins. Created in the artist's Hvarf garage studio during 1965-1967, a converted rural space that was documented in October 1967 before being destroyed by fire. The ironic titles (allegedly suggested by Dieter Roth) were inversely related to their visual appeal - the most miserable-looking was called 'The best piece,' with titles descending in flattery as the works became more visually interesting. The Frúöld were not well received; the public called them ugly and idiotic, questioning Pálsson's sanity. In response, he gathered the remaining pieces, piled them under the stairway to SÚM exhibition space on Vatnsstígur, poured concrete over them, and let them decompose. Only three survive in the Living Art Museum collection. The work exemplifies Pálsson's anti-art philosophy - childishly simple in concept, executed without traditional artistry, and deliberately unaesthetic, challenging Icelandic art's boundaries alongside contemporaneous provocations like the rye bread pile on Skólavörðuholt and SÚM's infamous hay bale.

This time-based sculpture captures the moment before the Coast Guard's helicopter lands, materializing the immaterial through three plaster forms arranged in a triangle on the floor. The forms are casts of the negative space between the helicopter's wheels and the ground, with different heights indicating temporal progression - the tail wheel, which lands last, is the highest. Time is here transformed into solid matter, exploring themes of anticipation, mechanical intervention, and the transformation of temporal experience into physical form.

The work consists of several 'sound sculptures' (hljóðskúlptúrar) arranged in two separate rooms, playing simultaneously to create an immersive audio environment. Drawing from childhood memories and fragments of conversation, the piece features fragmented narratives, coughing, clearing throats, yawning, humming, repetitions, and various human sounds that evoke gatherings of adults from another time and place. The installation includes physical elements: under each speaker (four speakers per 'rjóður' or room, creating stereo sound) are piles of snuff tobacco and large paper noses, referencing multiple senses and providing visual cues for the audio content. Individual sound sculptures have characteristically Icelandic folk humor titles including 'Enginn gleypir sólina... (þó hann bryðji tunglið eins og fisk)', 'Mús og lús', 'Hér pissa ég', and 'Herra Túrpur Jónsson'.
