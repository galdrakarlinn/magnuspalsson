      "content": "Bestu stykkin Three surviving sculptures from a larger anti-art series of cloth figures called Frúöld, created in 1965 and exhibited at Magnús Pálsson's debut solo exhibition at Ásmundarsalur in 1967. Made by stuffing old cloths with paper, stiffening with glue and paint until hard, then removing the paper so the cloth figures could stand like empty skins. Created in the artist's Hvarf garage studio during 1965-1967, a converted rural space that was documented in October 1967 before being destroyed by fire. The ironic titles (allegedly suggested by Dieter Roth) were inversely related to their visual appeal - the most miserable-looking was called 'The best piece,' with titles descending in flattery as the works became more visually interesting. The Frúöld were not well received; the public called them ugly and idiotic, questioning Pálsson's sanity. In response, he gathered the remaining pieces, piled them under the stairway to SÚM exhibition space on Vatnsstígur, poured concrete over them, and let them decompose. Only three survive in the Living Art Museum collection. The work exemplifies Pálsson's anti-art philosophy - childishly simple in concept, executed without traditional artistry, and deliberately unaesthetic, challenging Icelandic art's boundaries alongside contemporaneous provocations like the rye bread pile on Skólavörðuholt and SÚM's infamous hay bale.

This time-based sculpture captures the moment before the Coast Guard's helicopter lands, materializing the immaterial through three plaster forms arranged in a triangle on the floor. The forms are casts of the negative space between the helicopter's wheels and the ground, with different heights indicating temporal progression - the tail wheel, which lands last, is the highest. Time is here transformed into solid matter, exploring themes of anticipation, mechanical intervention, and the transformation of temporal experience into physical form. Exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1980 where Pálsson represented Iceland.

      "content": "Engin glypir solina (OG) Multi-channel sound sculpture installation created in 1983, later exhibited at Gallery One-One on Skólavörðustígur in 1993. The work consists of several 'sound sculptures' (hljóðskúlptúrar) arranged in two separate rooms, playing simultaneously to create an immersive audio environment. Drawing from childhood memories and fragments of conversation, the piece features fragmented narratives, coughing, clearing throats, yawning, humming, repetitions, and various human sounds that evoke gatherings of adults from another time and place. The installation includes physical elements: under each speaker (four speakers per 'rjóður' or room, creating stereo sound) are piles of snuff tobacco and large paper noses, referencing multiple senses and providing visual cues for the audio content. Individual sound sculptures have characteristically Icelandic folk humor titles including 'Enginn gleypir sólina... (þó hann bryðji tunglið eins og fisk)', 'Mús og lús', 'Hér pissa ég', and 'Herra Túrpur Jónsson'. The work was created with seven actors, a director, and sound engineer, with its strength lying in the sound mixing that places the listener 'in the middle of the picture.'
