      "description": "Magnús Pálsson represented Iceland at the Venice Biennale in 1980, where he exhibited various plaster works, including 'Sekúndurnar þar til Sikorskýþyrlan snertir' (The Seconds Before the Sikorsky Helicopter Touches), which captures the moment before the Coast Guard's Sikorsky helicopter lands. Three plaster forms create a triangle on the floor - the forms are casts of the space between the helicopter's wheels and the ground. Here Magnús is materializing the immaterial. The three sculptural elements are of different heights, indicating time within the work: the tail wheel, which lands last, is the highest. Time is here transformed into solid matter.

      "description": "Three surviving sculptures from a larger anti-art series of cloth figures called Frúöld, created in 1965 and exhibited at Magnús Pálsson's debut solo exhibition at Ásmundarsalur in 1967. Made by stuffing old cloths with paper, stiffening with glue and paint until hard, then removing the paper so the cloth figures could stand like empty skins. The ironic titles (allegedly suggested by Dieter Roth) were inversely related to their visual appeal - the most miserable-looking was called 'The best piece,' with titles descending in flattery as the works became more visually interesting. The Frúöld were not well received; the public called them ugly and idiotic, questioning Pálsson's sanity. In response, he gathered the remaining pieces, piled them under the stairway to SÚM exhibition space on Vatnsstígur, poured concrete over them, and let them decompose. Only three survive in the Living Art Museum collection. The work exemplifies Pálsson's anti-art philosophy - childishly simple in concept, executed without traditional artistry, and deliberately unaesthetic, challenging Icelandic art's boundaries alongside contemporaneous provocations like the rye bread pile on Skólavörðuholt and SÚM's infamous hay bale.
