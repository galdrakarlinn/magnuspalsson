      "description": "Conceptual work measuring anticipation and mechanical intervention, titled 'Sekúndurnar þar til Sikorskýþyrlan snertir' (The Seconds Before the Sikorsky Helicopter Touches Down). This time-based sculpture captures the moment before the Coast Guard's helicopter lands, materializing the immaterial through three plaster forms arranged in a triangle on the floor. The forms are casts of the negative space between the helicopter's wheels and the ground, with different heights indicating temporal progression - the tail wheel, which lands last, is the highest. Time is here transformed into solid matter, exploring themes of anticipation, mechanical intervention, and the transformation of temporal experience into physical form. Exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1980 where Pálsson represented Iceland. (Source: Reykjavík Art Museum collection description and Kjarvalstaðir catalog)",

      "title": "Bestu stykkin",
      "year": 1965,
      "description": "Three surviving sculptures from a larger anti-art series of cloth figures called Frúöld, created in 1965 and exhibited at Magnús Pálsson's debut solo exhibition at Ásmundarsalur in 1967. Made by stuffing old cloths with paper, stiffening with glue and paint until hard, then removing the paper so the cloth figures could stand like empty skins. Created in the artist's Hvarf garage studio during 1965-1967, a converted rural space that was documented in October 1967 before being destroyed by fire. The ironic titles (allegedly suggested by Dieter Roth) were inversely related to their visual appeal - the most miserable-looking was called 'The best piece,' with titles descending in flattery as the works became more visually interesting. The Frúöld were not well received; the public called them ugly and idiotic, questioning Pálsson's sanity. In response, he gathered the remaining pieces, piled them under the stairway to SÚM exhibition space on Vatnsstígur, poured concrete over them, and let them decompose. Only three survive in the Living Art Museum collection. The work exemplifies Pálsson's anti-art philosophy - childishly simple in concept, executed without traditional artistry, and deliberately unaesthetic, challenging Icelandic art's boundaries alongside contemporaneous provocations like the rye bread pile on Skólavörðuholt and SÚM's infamous hay bale.

      "description": "A plaster cast of a valley mist, where mist was rendered as positive form and the valley as negative. Pálsson described it: 'Very low mist creeps up the valley from the sea, covering only the bottom so that from the low hills stick their heads up through it… cotton-wool-like mist. Very lovely.' This work exemplifies his practice of materializing ephemeral atmospheric phenomena through casting techniques.",

      "description": "Multi-channel sound sculpture installation created in 1983, later exhibited at Gallery One-One on Skólavörðustígur in 1993. The work consists of several 'sound sculptures' (hljóðskúlptúrar) arranged in two separate rooms, playing simultaneously to create an immersive audio environment. Drawing from childhood memories and fragments of conversation, the piece features fragmented narratives, coughing, clearing throats, yawning, humming, repetitions, and various human sounds that evoke gatherings of adults from another time and place. The installation includes physical elements: under each speaker (four speakers per 'rjóður' or room, creating stereo sound) are piles of snuff tobacco and large paper noses, referencing multiple senses and providing visual cues for the audio content. Individual sound sculptures have characteristically Icelandic folk humor titles including 'Enginn gleypir sólina... (þó hann bryðji tunglið eins og fisk)', 'Mús og lús', 'Hér pissa ég', and 'Herra Túrpur Jónsson'. The work was created with seven actors, a director, and sound engineer, with its strength lying in the sound mixing that places the listener 'in the middle of the picture.' (Source: Eiríkur Þorláksson review, Morgunblaðið, February 24, 1993)",

      "description": "Multi-part work featuring animals and musical notation, exhibited at Galleri Gangur in 1982. The work combines drawings and musical compositions featuring various animals: hani (cockerel), krummi (crow), hundur (dog), and svin (pig), along with birds, horses, and mice. The integration of animal imagery with musical notation suggests an exploration of sound, nature, and artistic expression across different media.",

The works were made by pouring plaster into children's clothing, using the clothes as moulds which were destroyed in the process, leaving only the stiffened forms. Pálsson emphasized their unesthetic, awkward presence — weight, smell, and the memory of use were part of the work. Some figures were given names such as 'Intelligent child' and 'Deceitful child'. The work has been exhibited internationally, including at Gallery Fodor in Amsterdam, and represents a significant exploration of childhood, materiality, and the transformation of everyday objects into sculptural form.",
