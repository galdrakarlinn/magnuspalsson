# Magnús Pálsson Works Catalog (1965-1993)

This catalog contains comprehensive descriptions of Magnús Pálsson's works based on archival documentation.

## The Best Pieces (1965)
Made from old plaster-covered clothes, these sculptures were among Pálsson's earliest experiments. The work used discarded garments filled with plaster, later cast aside or decomposed, but some survived. They challenged conventional sculpture by presenting everyday forms as brittle monuments.

## Plaster children (1970)
A series of life-size sculptures of children made by pouring plaster into their clothing. The clothes acted as moulds and were destroyed in the process, leaving only the stiffened forms. Pálsson emphasized their unesthetic, awkward presence — weight, smell, and the memory of use were part of the work. He gave some figures names such as Intelligent child and Deceitful child.

## Dream true (1969) & Clairvoyant (1969)
Two works in plaster. Pálsson remarked that plaster suited his conceptual art of the period: a "dead and unpretentious" material, not signifying anything in itself the way marble or bronze do.

## The seconds until the Sikorsky Helicopter touches down (1976)
Shown at the Venice Biennial in 1980. Three plaster casts of the empty space between the tyres of a Coast Guard helicopter and the ground. When arranged, they formed a triangle on the floor (approx. 370 cm at the base, 550 cm at the apex), freezing the instant before touchdown.

## The maple's dream of a mountain (1975)
Three plaster pieces (one suspended, two placed on a table) representing the frozen sound of a hunting bugle, inspired by Baron Münchhausen's tale of sounds freezing in winter air and later thawing by the fire. The work embodied Pálsson's interest in giving sound a material body.

## Swedish Psalms (1975)
Plaster casts of a half-open hymn book, wedge-shaped pieces about 22 cm long. These works turned sound and faith into solidified, absurd forms.

## What Nefertite whispered to Alexander the Great on the pillow (1975)
A plaster cast of the space between a whisperer's mouth and a listener's ear resting on a pillow. The negative space of sound and intimacy is preserved as sculpture.

## Beach (1975)
A plaster cast in three parts — of the beach, the sea, and the sky. When fitted together, they formed a seamless block. Each part had a positive value relative to the others, but together the values cancelled out — a mathematical reflection of positive/negative balance.

## The sound of a bugle in a shoe box (1975)
A small plaster work representing the muffled, enclosed sound of a bugle confined within an absurd container.

## Displacement of a space with two people (1976)
Exhibited at Kjarvalsstaðir. Plaster casts were made at four points between Pálsson's sons and the wall, their shoes, calves, and surrounding floor. The casts were then shifted into the gallery space while their relations stayed intact, displacing the space of presence.

## Valley mist (1975)
A plaster cast of a valley mist, where mist was rendered as positive form and the valley as negative. Pálsson described it: "Very low mist creeps up the valley from the sea, covering only the bottom so that from the low hills stick their heads up through it… cotton-wool-like mist. Very lovely."

## Mathematics (1976)
Plaster casts of mathematical equations scratched into sand. Casts were made, then re-cast using the previous cast as mould, resulting in mirrored sequences. A literal embodiment of abstract equations.

## Cubic Bjarnar (1976)
A conceptual and esthetic work. A bathtub filled with water, presented in the gallery as a "cube of Bjarnar," referencing Pálsson's friend Björn. The repeated form mirrored the sea, raising questions of presence, absence, and absurdity.

## Hummingbird, mouse, kangaroo (1980)
An outdoor installation using typewriters and objects arranged in the landscape, linked to Njál's Saga and the theme of memorial. Everyday materials (typewriters, pedestals) became absurd monuments to memory, humour, and folklore.

## Sundials (1965–77)
A series of thin lacquered metal plates with wedges cut into them. When the sun shone, the wedge cast a shadow pointing to inscribed words. One sundial, Lovemaking in the morning, showed a heart cut in two by its shadow.

## In memory of the ghost Írafellsmóri (1977)
Three vertical sticks with keyholes aligned so that one could see "through" the ghost. Based on a haunting in Hvalfjörður that Pálsson linked to his own experiences — including a ghost allegedly cutting electricity during a later video performance. A playful and uncanny merging of folklore with conceptual art.

## Bum mud book (1976)
A plaster book-object. Each page held casts of words ("bum" and "mud"), playing with positive/negative form and absurd opposites. Connected to Fluxus humour and Duchampian absurdity.

## Barcarolle in F sharp major (1980)
First shown in Akureyri's Red House. Visitors listened to Chopin's barcarolle until Pálsson stopped the music and required silence. Those who moved had their outlines traced and later cast in plaster. The casts were placed on the floor, marking absence.

## The Anti-Society League Concert (1982)
Developed from Barcarolle. In Norrköping, Sweden, a punk band played while Pálsson traced and cast negative spaces of people and furniture. The casts were then reassembled as a clump — the material residue of sound and presence.

## Teaching the craziest branch of art (1984–86)
Exhibitions, books, and recordings made with students, emphasizing teaching itself as conceptual practice. Works include Mumbling Eye (1984, a book) and Ranimask (1984, multiples made with students).

## Island Symphony (1978)
A record jacket made with Hermann Nitsch and students, connecting performance and object.

## Poi poi drame (1978)
A collaborative Fluxus-inspired postcard project with Robert Filliou and students.

## Stage production with People's Theatre and National Theatre (1991)
Sprengdi hljóðhimnu, vinstra megin (Bursting the eardrum, left side). A theatre piece blending spoken word, performance, and sculptural presence.

## No one forgets Mr. Tarpur Jansson (1993)
Performance in four rooms of Skólavörðuholt tower. Audience members encountered fragments of memory, absurd objects, and live readings by actors. The work explored forgetting and absurd memory as theatre.

## No one swallows the sun (1993)
Installation with voices and papier-mâché noses. Snuff piles and clownish noses surrounded hidden speakers that emitted grunts and rhymes. Actors recited nonsense verses, highlighting triviality, humour, and absurdity as material for art.
